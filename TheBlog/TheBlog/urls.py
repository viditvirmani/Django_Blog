"""TheBlog URL Configuration
The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.conf.urls import url, include
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^blog/', include('blog.urls'))
    All the urls defined in my 1st app are included,DONE TO AVOID MESS and so define urls.py in your app
    THE ROOT DIRECTORY SHOULDN'T BE MESSY SO WE USE INCLUDE() AND RATHER DEFINE ALL THE URLS IN URLS.py OF EACH APP
